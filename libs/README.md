# Static QSobt libraries
QSOpt is a linear solver, its official website is here: https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~bico/qsopt/. 
Checked into this directory are versions of it built for x86_64 Linux, Mac, and Apple Silicon Mac.

Also, there is an Apple Silicon build of qsopt-ex, an exact (rational numbers rather than floating point) related library
to qsopt itself. A fork of libqsopt_ex hosted here: https://github.com/jonls/qsopt-ex was the source to build it.
